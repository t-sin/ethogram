# Ethogram - A testing framework for Common Lisp

*Ethogram* is a testing framework for Common Lisp. This aims to define expressive tests. This refres like testing frameworks for the behavior-driven development but not only aims to that.

## Status

**CURRENTLY CONSIDERING**

## Features

- Several ways to define tests
- Grouping some tests
- Useful expectation matchers
- (Basic mocking frameworks?) (...is what?)

## How to define tests

*Ethogram* has several ways to define tests. One of them is for define a relation between inputs and outputs of an operator. Second one of them is for define a behavior of some operators. (and more test types...?.)

The definitions for a system are composed of some groups like, *A*, *B* and *C* (TBD; I don't know suitable grouping words in English...).

### Defining a unit

```lisp
;; some examples here
```

### Defining a behavior

```lisp
